                    This Section will introduce you to What webservice are, 

                            The two different types of webservices

                            and The two different java standards that deal with these two webservices.<br>
                  </div>
                  <div>
                    <h2>What ?</h2>
                            Webservices are client server or consumer provider applications

                            that communicate on the network

                            through the http protocol and

                            and exchange messages or data

                            as XML and in various other formats like JSON.<br><br>

                            They provide interoperability between software applications, 

                            meaning software applications running or developed in different programming languages

                            can communicate with each other

                            irrespective of the platform they are running on.<br><br>

                            A java application running on a linux environment

                            can communicate with a dotnet or python application

                            running in windows environment. <br><br>

                            They allow applications to be developed in a loosely coupled fashion

                            that is two or more applications can communicate with each other

                            or can be integrated in a loosely coupled fashion. <br><br>

                            Application A which is using the services of application B

                            through webservices today

                            can easily switch to application C

                            to get the same functionality

                            as what the application B was

                            providing it in a very loosely coupled fashion without changing a lot of code. <br><br>

                            Our clients can extend our applications through webservices. <br><br>

                            They can integrate the inhouse products which you have

                            or products from another company

                            with the product which we sell them

                            through the webservices which we expose. <br><br>

                            They can come up with their own logic by consuming our webservices. <br><br>

                            We can also develop mashup applications which can be

                            consumers of more than one webservice. <br><br>

                            For example, while I was working on a project management product at Oracle

                            we have developed a small demo mashup

                            which pulled project information of a road work

                            from the project management applications database through the webservices

                            and then it called into the google maps webservices

                            to plot the progress of the road work on the google map. <br><br><br><br>

                            They are two different flavors or types of webservices.<br><br>

                            The first is the big webservices or the SOAP webservices

                            which used XML based SOAP messages on the http post method.<br><br>

                            So the webservice provider and consumer in this case

                            communicate using SOAP

                            which is an xml and then they use

                            http post to do this message exchange.<br><br>

                            Secondly, the even more powerful RESTFUL webservices

                            which use http method to the full

                            that is they use all the methods available in the http protocol

                            as a standard

                            and then they support multiple

                            data formats, thats the big feature of RESTFul webservices

                            along with XML they support JASON, TEXT , etc..
                            <br><br>
                            Each language and platform has standards for implementing

                            these two types of webservices.<br><br>

                            They provide us with tools to implement the SOAP as well as RESTFUL webservices.

                            In the Java world, JAXWS is the standard for implementing

                            SOAP based webservices.<br><br>

                            JAX-WS stands for JAVA API for XML based webservices.<br><br>

                            Secondly JAX-RS is a standard for implementing

                            RESTFul webservices.<br><br>

                            JAX-RS as you can guess stands for

                            Java-API for restful webservices.<br><br>

                            We as developers will master these two

                            these two standards to implement

                            our webservices. <br><br>

                            The concepts of SOAP and RESTFul services

                            and these two standards

                            are presented in detail

                            in the first and second half of this course respectively. <br><br>
